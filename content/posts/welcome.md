Welcome to Rail4Iceland! We are promoting the creation of a railway in Iceland, to help all Icelanders and tourists get around. Rail is greener, quicker and cleaner than planes and cars, and as Icelandâ€™s population and tourists rise, a railway would help reduce emissions and congestion.

Thank you for visiting our site, please share to spread the word!
